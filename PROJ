#  Incident Response Analysis Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework

# Overview
This project demonstrates how I analyzed a mock security incident using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)**. The report walks through each stage, including identifying threats, analyzing logs, and drafting a response plan.

# Goals
- Practice applying a real-world cybersecurity framework
- Build documentation and reporting skills
- Understand how to respond to phishing attacks

# Project Highlights
- Simulated a phishing attack targeting employee emails
- Used the NIST CSF to organize the response strategy
- Documented all findings, observations, and suggested remediations

# Files
- `incident_report_nist_framework.pdf`: Full report on the security incident
- `analysis_notes.md`: Markdown notes explaining each stage of the process
- `screenshots/`: Visual evidence from email headers and packet captures

## Skills Used
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Basic threat detection
- Log analysis
- Technical writing
