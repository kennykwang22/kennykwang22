#  Incident Response Analysis Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework                                              June 3rd, 2025

# Overview
This project demonstrates how I analyzed a mock security incident using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)**. 
The report walks through each stage, including identifying threats, analyzing logs, and drafting a response plan.

# Goals
- Practice applying a real-world cybersecurity framework
- Build documentation and reporting skills
- Understand how to respond to phishing attacks

# Project Highlights
- Simulated a phishing attack targeting employee emails
- Used the NIST CSF to organize the response strategy
- Documented all findings, observations, and suggested remediations

## Skills Used
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Basic threat detection
- Log analysis
- Technical writing
