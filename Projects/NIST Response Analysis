#  Incident Response Analysis Using NIST Cybersecurity Framework                                              June 3rd, 2025

# Overview
This project demonstrates how I analyzed a mock security incident using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)**. 
The report walks through each stage, including identifying threats, analyzing logs, and drafting a response plan.

# Goals
- Practice applying a real-world cybersecurity framework
- Build documentation and reporting skills
- Understand how to respond to phishing attacks

# Project Highlights
- Used the NIST CSF to organize the response strategy
- Documented all findings and observations

# Skills Used
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- Basic threat detection
- Log analysis
- Technical writing

# What I Learned
- What type of attack occurred, the scope of the incident, and its impact to the organization
- Potential network vulnerabilities and protection measures
- Detection tools to monitor and secure the network
- How to respond to cybersecurity incidents in the future
- Recovery plans to restore normal operations
